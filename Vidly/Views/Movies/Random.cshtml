<!-- applied to the advisory we would want to use the model directive and specify the view model we create for EmailDetails-->

@model Vidly.ViewModels.RandomMovieViewModel
@{
    ViewBag.Title = "Random Movie";
    Layout = "~/Views/Shared/_Layout.cshtml";
}

@{
    var className = Model.Customers.Count > 0 ? "popular" : null;
}


@* 
    Applied to the advisory we could loop through the EmailDetails like we do customers and render markup from there
    (So basiically a new match container for each loop interation)
*@

<h2 class="@className">@Model.Movie.Name</h2>

@if (Model.Customers.Count == 0)
{
    <text>No one has rented this movie before.</text>
}
else
{
    <ul>
        @foreach (var customer in Model.Customers)
        {
            <li>@customer.Name</li>
        }

    </ul>
}
